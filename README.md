Course materials for [2011](http://www.iris.edu/hq/es_course/content/2011.html). Announcement for 2014 [here](http://www.iris.edu/hq/short-courses/course/iris_earthscope_usarray_data_processing_and_analysis_short_course_2014).

Why learn all this?
-------------------
* [Why scientists and engineers must learn to program](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/166115-why-scientists-and-engineers-must-learn-programming/fulltext)

Finding solutions to your questions
-----------------------------------

* [How to ask questions the smart way.](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), for computer science/programming related questions

Developing Software
-------------------
* [Why use Github?](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/)
* [Introduction to Github](https://github.com/pysmo/aimbat-docs/wiki/Introduction-to-Github)
* [Why you must write good documentation](http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/docs-or-it-doesnt-exist/)
* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), a tool for creating online documentation easily
* Don't develop something complex in one go. Try to develop a simplified version, test it throughly, and then integrate it to the code you are developing. 

Speeding up code execution time
-------------------------------
* [High-Performance Computing](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/services/quest.html), most universities have supercomputers to run code faster, check with your department
* [Parallel Computing](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/), run several jobs at the same time
* Check for bottlenecks. What part of the code takes longest to execute? Try minimize the number of times that part is called/ do caching, etc. 

Open source software
--------------------
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Enthough Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/), easy to install package for python

Useful Seismology Tools
-----------------------
* [Obspy](http://aimbat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), library for manipulating and processing seismology data
* [AIMBAT](http://aimbat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), picking teleseismic arrival times
* [Seismic Analysis Code (SAC)](http://www.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/manual.html)
* [Standing Order for Data (SOD)](http://www.seis.sc.edu/sod/)
